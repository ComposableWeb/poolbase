## Information Pool for Groups and Companies

Do not try to swim in the sea of information that Google offers.

Create your own pool and let machines do the work for you.

You just chuck in the links to what interests you and your group and a knowledge pool is created, instantly searchable, always up to date, useful without distractions.
